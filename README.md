A fork of the original RaspberryPints project, with hopes to update the software and share with fellow brewers. 



//Original Project README.md below//

RaspberryPints (rPints) is a digital upgrade to the conventional chalkboard taplist, created just for the home brewer. Display your current beers on tap with a sleek, digital presentation. Manage your beers, recipes, kegs, and taps with our built-in tracking system.
